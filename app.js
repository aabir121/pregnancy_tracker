Within hours of fertilization, the single cell begins rapid division. By day 4-5, the cells form a hollow ball called a blastocyst, containing an inner cell mass that will become your baby and an outer layer that will form the placenta. The blastocyst travels through the fallopian tube toward the uterus, preparing for implantation.",
